main thing: general improvements to cosmic encounter experience

##  TABLE DESIGN

- Warp in the middle
- Score track around it
- Card holders around that
- Play area (large)
- Ship ring


##  SPECIFIC ITEMS

I want to push some buttons and have the whole game dealt out for me. That means:

- Choosing which expansions to enable
- Choosing which extra features we want from those expansions
- Gathering cards together in the centre
- Dealing aliens and flares to players
- Filtering the destiny deck for seated players
- Creating snap points for decks and discards


### Cards drawn from decks should be tagged like that deck


### Throwing cards into the warp should automatically sort them into their appropriate discard piles


Requirements:

- Scripting zone over the warp
    - maybe multiple zones to round out the shape? should be okay if the performance doesn't deteriorate
- Every individual card tagged with the deck it came from


### The warp should display how many ships it contains, both per player and total
